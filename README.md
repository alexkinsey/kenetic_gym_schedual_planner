Kinetic Gym Schedule Planner helps users manage gym members and classes. Users can create, edit, and delete both members and classes. Users can also assign members to classes to track attendance. Member types, such as Premium, automatically restrict which classes members are eligible for. The interface has been designed with both desktops and tablets in mind.

# What's next?

This application still requires the ability to create, edit, and delete gym instructors.
The database could be refactored to prevent data from being duplicated.
